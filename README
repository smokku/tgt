1. WHAT IS TGT

TGT (TextmodeGUIToolkit) is a parially object-oriented library for creating
user interfaces under Linux console. It's designed as an alternative for
ncurses - however it does not use its philosophy - in TGT model, not only all
terminal functions but also all GUI management things are done by TGT, thus
giving the developer a chance to concentrate on more important things in
his program than user interface. Many TGT concepts are taken from
AmigaOS / MagicUserInterface for AmigaOS.

Currently, the thing we are worrying mostly about is that TGT can not be
used in programs that intend to be portable.

2. REQUIREMENTS

- libdl - shipped with many linux distributions
- LinuxThreads pthread library - as above

- libutil - also comes with many distributions 
- libgpm - comes with GPM mouse server

There are mechanisms implemented in TGT that allow it to manage without libutil
and libgpm when they're not available - some magic configuration scripts will
propably appear in next versions.

- libtermcap - It's not compulsory - actually tgt will manage without it 
            (or with termcap linked to ncurses) - however that kind of
	    situation will require some tuning in rcfiles, unless your
	    terminal is a standart linux one

3. INSTALLATION

make
make install

or

make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`

(in bash)

4. TESTS

If you are new to TGT you can try running files from tests/ subdirectory
in order to get familar with controls, mouse support, etc.

5. INPUT DEVICES

Default key mappings:

Up
Left       Switch to the previous object in a window
Tab
Down
Right      Switch to the next object in a window
`          Switch windows
Ctrl W     Enter/left window moving mode - when it's turned on, cursor
           keys will let you reposition your windows.
Enter/
Space      Perform an action on current object
Esc
Delete
Backspace  Part menu

Try the mouse support yourself ... ;)

6. PROGRAMMER'S VIEW

If you want to know more about TGT because you want to use TGT routines
in your applications - see examples/ directory. I personally think that
writing any documentation for developers is boring, both for the reader
and the writer (maybe someone will write a kind of tutorial in the future,
but don't count on me - I'm too lazy) - it's really easier to write and
to understand an example. Also - check doc/en/CONCEPTS and doc/en/reference 

7. DEVELOPERS WANTED

If you think you can help developing TGT (especially - if you can make it
run on 64bit machines (erm, I don't even know if it works - 
I don't have any account on such computers =/) or you can make it run
under other systems than linux); or you are able to write new documentation,
(and of course correct our English in the old documents ;) -
please let me know (just mailto mtg@elsat.net.pl)
