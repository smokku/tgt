I personally (vlsi) wish to thank ...

- Piotrek 'kaczorek' Kaczmarek <kaczorek@msg.beta.pl>
            ... for his bug reports, feature requests, and for being
	        TheFirstTGTProgrammerWhoDoesNotKnowHowDoesItInternallyWork(TM)

- Krzysztof 'so_lame' Rusocki <kszysiu@main.braxis.co.uk>
            ... for bug reports & being the first TGT tester that reported
	        the state of EVERY test.

- Michal 'Piaskowy' Ziemba <zib@jaszczur.org>
            ... for testing on a SPARC machine


I (smoku) wish to thank the above people and also:

- Mateusz 'vlsi' Golicz <mtg@elsat.net.pl>
	    ... for his patience to my emotion's explosions
		and for bringing to life all my crazy concepts (almost all)
