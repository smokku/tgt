In subdirectories of this directory you can find examples of TGT usage in
C programs, from the less (1, 3, ...) to the most complicated ones (5).

Every source file is equipped with comments ... This set of examples aims
to be a TGT programming tutorial ...

Remember, that the general rule is: run before trying to understand :)
