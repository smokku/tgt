1. ,,I see qqqqqqq's and xxxxx's instead of semigraphic frames around windows.
   
   This problem has occured eg. in RedHat 7.1 default install (thanks kaczorek).
   The possible solutions are:
   
        - add as (^N for normal linux terminal) and ae (^O) codes to your
	  /etc/termcap
	- add to your ~/.tgtrc or /etc/.tgtrc:
	
	   [terminal]
	   gfx_start=\x0e
	   gfx_end=\x0f

        - copy examples/.tgtrc to your ~ and uncomment these lines:
	
           gfx=-|[]++++
           gfx_start=
           gfx_end=
	

   If this happens 'under' the ,,screen'' program, you can also copy .tgtrc
   delivered with tgt (in examples/) to your home directory and try
   uncommenting lines under these ones:
   
       # Uncomment to have semigraphics under screen
       # (Thanks to kaczorek, <kaczorek@msg.beta.pl>)

	   


2. ,,My mouse in TGT does not work ! It acts just like on a normal console,
   all I can do is copy and paste text!''
    
   Ensure that:
      - your gpm is running ;)
      - you are running TGT applications on a REAL tty (check it with tty
        command) - ie. there're no other applications that catch mouse events
	from that console. I personally often run TGT tests 'under' Midnight
	Commander - and you can imagine the first tries with mouse support
	"Butbutbut ! It worked a while ago ! I didn't touched the source tree!"
        ;)
      - /dev/gpmctl has proper permissions (it has to be readable and writable
        by you)
      - you do not use devfs - because as for version 1.19.3 , libgpm assumes
        that your tty devices are named *exactly* /dev/tty<vt_number>
	(smoku has a devfs-"fixed" gpm so you can bug him)

3. ,,When I press backspace, strange things happen ...''

   This often is caused by a bad backspace entry in /etc/termcap - do a
   showkey -a (or -m in certain versions of showkey such as the Red Hat one), press backspace ,
   and compare returned values with bc entry for terminal 'linux' in /etc/termcap file ....
