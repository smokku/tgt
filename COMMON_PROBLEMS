1. My mouse in TGT does not work ! It acts just like on a normal console,
   all I can do is copy and paste text!
    
   Ensure that:
      - your gpm is running ;)
      - you are running TGT applications on a REAL tty (check it with tty
        command) - ie. there're no other applications that catch mouse events
	from that console. I personally often run TGT tests 'under' Midnight
	Commander - and you can imagine the first tries with mouse support
	"Butbutbut ! It worked a while ago ! I didn't touched the source tree!"
        ;)
      - /dev/gpmctl has proper permissions (it has to be readable and writable
        by you)
      - you do not use devfs - because as for version 1.19.3 , libgpm assumes
        that your tty devices are named *exactly* /dev/tty<vt_number>

2. When I press backspace, strange things happen ...

   This often is caused by a bad backspace entry in /etc/termcap - do a
   showkey -a , press backspace , and compare returned values with bc entry
   for terminal 'linux' in /etc/termcap file ....
