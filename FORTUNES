<mteg> Sure. Write it then. If its execution time won't depend on the
       'way' between objects in the Tree ...
<mteg> (I remind you it's called every screen pixel)
<mteg> I'll buy you beer/coffee/tea/cola/whatever whenever we meet
<smoku> and now you'll kick me
<smoku> "i'll cache it"? ;>>>>

<smoku> Yeah. Now i can go sleep, I did everything that was up to me,
        I solved a big problem , generating as a solution a new
	one - equally complicated.

        tongues while reading my name

<smoku> kaczorek: if he starts writing from beginning, he again 
        won't let me sleep
