                        Ngtk v0.06.x TODO file

These are the most urgent things that (I think) will be made in ngtk for
future releases.

D -> Done (you shouldn't see this very often ! =)
U -> Urgent
N -> Need to do (and will do)
S -> Maybe some day
O -> A little more serious than just an idea ;-)
? -> Just an idea

* Widgets to add:
    - The capability to use several widgets simultaneously in the same 
      window (U)
    - Horizontal menu (for menu bars) (N) 
      [ a menu bar is experimentally implemented in the test program ]
    - Menu separators & other specials items (ie. disabled, default...) (N)
    - Hot keys for all widgets (N)
    - Scrolling :
        * Vertical (D, buggy)
        * Horizontal (N)
        * Scrollbar (N)
    - Check list widget (like the radio widget, but where several simulteanous
      choices are possible) (N)
    - Toggle buttons (N)
    - Independent buttons (N)
    - All the common features included in lxdialog (checklist, radiolist,
      textbox, input box) (N)
    - A multi-lined, scrollable input space (N) (eg. notebook)
    - Splitted boxes (go play with lxdialog to see what I'm talking about) (S)
    - File selector ? (O)
    - Tool tips !? (may be quite ugly ;-) (?)

* Display features to add:
    - Window resizing (N)
    - Text auto-wrapping in windows (N)
    - Making a "transparent" shadow under the windows, so that areas under
      the shadow aren't totally black, but have their background black and
      their foreground dark gray. (O)

* Input features to add:
    - Fixing the bugs of 'ncurses only' text input (when not using slang) (U)
    - Improve key codes portability (N)
    - Better line editing code (D, must be tested intensively)
    - Virtual edit/input space for text entry (D, test stage)
    - mouse (gpm) support (S)

* Misc:
    - Really multi-threaded execution (for the moment, only the keyboard input
      runs in a separate thread from the main loop) (U)
    - config script, either ~/.ngtkrc or/and /etc/ngtkrc, to define the default
      behaviors of the lib (like the escape timeout in SLang version) (N)
    - Finish ngtkdialog, a lxdialog-clone app, to use ngtk in the Linux 
      kernel's 'menuconfig' Makefile option, including :
        * menu (N)
        * checklist (N)
        * radiolist (N)
        * textbox (N)
        * inputbox (N) [nearly done but not stable yet]
        * yesno (D)
    - ASCII/ANSI graphics ;)) (S) (aalib support)
    - Finishing the man pages. (U)
    - autoconf/automake build process (for portability) (N)
    - All the needed features to develop a text editor, or/and an IDE (S)
    - Using Glib ??? (?) (would increase portability a lot)

And many, many other things I can't remember now.
