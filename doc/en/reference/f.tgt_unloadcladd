NAME

tgt_unloadclass - free memory allocated by tgt_loadclass

SYNOPSIS

void tgt_unloadclass(void *ptr);

DESCRIPTION

tgt_unloadclass could be called when a class which was loaded by tgt_loadclass
is no longer used by the application. It is (as for TGT v 0.091) currently
equivalent to dlclose(ptr);
